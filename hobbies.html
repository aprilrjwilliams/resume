        <p><b>CTM:</b> As the lead engineer of the CTM Integrations project, I migrated old infrastructure from hybrod PCS Cloud to AWS, saving Duke Energy over $22,000.
            The development process included using Kafka, a data pipelining tool, to stream real time data to CTM. Event driven architecture was accomplished by using multiple lambdas (written in python)
            in AWS to manipulate, store, process, transform, and stream data from RDS (using PostgresSQL) to CTM. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Experiment Application:</b> Designed, developed, and deployed an internal application used by the product team at Pack Health to retieve and display data from our experimentation framework.
            It aided in the growth and development of future features. Frontend: angular, backend: typescript and PostgresSQL.</p>
